# MTH
MTH--Matching for tumor heterogeneity--Whole slide image matching for tumor heterogeneity quantification.

# Project Overview
Malignant tumors represent a significant global health threat, and one of the key challenges in cancer treatment is tumor heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is characterized by diverse morphological and phenotypic variations within and between tumors, complicating the development of effective, individualized treatment strategies. Automating the analysis process is essential to support pathologists in accurately interpreting tumor characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis. This project focuses on the automatic matching of serial whole slide images (WSIs) to accurately quantify tumor heterogeneity, a critical factor in the reliability of personalized treatment strategies.
